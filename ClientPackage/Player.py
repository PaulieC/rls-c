    Class Player is used as the top level class abstraction to play in a Tournament
    It specifies what a concrete Player must do to be a part of the Tournament
    Each Player can be registered for a Tournament
    Concrete implementations of a Player will play against other ones playing
    the same game.
    Since there can be many player types for many games
    the AI for making moves in the 'play' function must be
    delegated to the concrete implementations that subclass Player.

    Ex: A Rock Paper Scissors Player that subclasses Player would
    define some AI in 'play' to return 'rock' 'paper or 'scissors'
